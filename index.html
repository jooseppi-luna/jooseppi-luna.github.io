        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>My name is Jooseppi, and I am a Senior at UMass Lowell pursuing a 
           double-major in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. I have
           have been a software co-op at Mercury Systems since May 2017, and 
           am starting a position as Software Engineering Co-op at Arista
           Networks in summer 2018. 
           <br><br>
           As I approach graduation in Fall 2018, I am looking for a full-time
           position and would love to hear about any potential opportunities!
           Please contact me using my phone or e-mail from the contacts page.</p>
