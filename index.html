                <h2>Hello there!<br></h2>
                <p>
                   My name is Jooseppi, and I am a Senior at UMass Lowell pursuing a 
                   double-major in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. I have
                   have been a Software Engineering Co-op at Mercury Systems since May 
                   2017, and am starting a position as Software Engineering Intern at 
                   Arista Networks in May 2018.  <br><br>
                   [stuff about me, passions, hobbies]<br><br>
                   As I approach graduation in Fall 2018, I am looking for a full-time
                   position and would love to hear about any potential opportunities by
                   phone, e-mail, or LinkedIn.</p>
